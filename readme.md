##What the heck is this?
This mostly exists for archival purposes. Look at my extreme newbie code and laugh, or learn something from it! It is one of the first real projects I actually decided to work on, and I put quite a lot of time in it.

Basically, it is a small quiz game, with an incredibly weird scoring system and a stupid way to save scores. It works, though, and you can play it by simply opening `pyques.py`.

...Oh, and all of the questions are translated from Swedish and might not make sense at all. Feel free to edit the question list!
